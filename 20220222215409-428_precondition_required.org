#+title: 428 Precondition Required (RFC 6585)
What does HTTP status code 428 mean?
* Back
428 Precondition Required (RFC 6585)

The origin server requires the request to be conditional. Intended to prevent the 'lost update' problem, where a client GETs a resource's state, modifies it, and PUTs it back to the server, when meanwhile a third party has modified the state on the server, leading to conflict.
